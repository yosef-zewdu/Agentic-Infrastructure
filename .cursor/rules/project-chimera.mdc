# Project Chimera — Cursor Rules

## Project Context

**This is Project Chimera, an autonomous influencer system.**

- Hierarchical Swarm architecture: Planner → Worker → Judge
- Spec-Driven Development (SDD): Specs own intent, contracts, and safety
- MCP as the sole integration boundary for external I/O
- Key specs: `specs/_meta.md`, `specs/functional.md`, `specs/technical.md`

---

## The Prime Directive

**NEVER generate code without checking specs/ first.**

1. Before implementing any feature, read the relevant spec(s) in `specs/`
2. Verify the spec is APPROVED or DRAFT with clear requirements
3. If no spec exists for the requested work, refuse and propose creating one
4. Implementation MUST align with API contracts in `specs/technical.md` and user stories in `specs/functional.md`

---

## Traceability

**Explain your plan before writing code.**

1. **State the goal**: What spec(s) and user story(ies) this implements
2. **Outline the approach**: Which components, skills, or APIs are involved
3. **Reference contracts**: Cite the JSON schema or table from `specs/technical.md`
4. **Then implement**: Write code only after the plan is clear and spec-aligned

## Quick Reference

| Action | Required Step |
|--------|---------------|
| New feature | Check `specs/functional.md` for user story; create spec if missing |
| API/Skill | Check `specs/technical.md` and `specs/main/contracts/` for contracts |
| Data model | Check `specs/technical.md` ERD and `specs/main/data-model.md` |
| Commit | Include `Spec:` and `Test:` lines in commit body |
